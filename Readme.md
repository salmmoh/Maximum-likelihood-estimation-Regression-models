Built Maximum likelihood functions for different distributions.

Maximum likelihood is one of the most commonly used approaches for model estimation. 
 The steps involved in maximum likelihood estimation are:
1. Specify the model form. This is used to write out the probability of an individual observation as a
function of the parameters to be estimated.
2. Create the likelihood function. This is the joint probability of the observing the sample as a function
of the parameters to be estimated. Transform to a log likelihood function.
3. Optimize the log likelihood function to obtain the parameter estimates.
A significant challenge in maximum likelihood estimation is optimizing the log likelihood function for
parameter estimation
